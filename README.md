## AdventureWorks Database Analysis with Python

## Introduction
In this analysis, I will be exploring various aspects of the AdventureWorks database using SQL queries. The AdventureWorks database contains information related to sales, customers, products, and more, making it an excellent source for data analysis. We will answer ten advanced SQL questions, each designed to provide valuable insights into the data.

## Prerequisites
Before running the SQL queries, ensure you have access to the AdventureWorks database and an SQL client.

## Questions and Answers

### 1. Find the Top 5 Customers with the Highest Total Sales Amount

```sql
-- SQL Query 1: Find the Top 5 Customers with the Highest Total Sales Amount

SELECT TOP 5
    CustomerKey,                      -- Select the customer key
    SUM(OrderQuantity * UnitPrice) AS Total  -- Calculate the total sales amount for each customer

FROM 
    FactInternetSales  -- Specify the FactInternetSales table

GROUP BY 
    CustomerKey  -- Group the results by customer key to aggregate sales for each customer

ORDER BY 
    Total DESC;  -- Order the results by total sales amount in descending order
```
